I was presented with the objective to refactor a marketing agency's code. 
Here are are the step I took to completed this objective:

First, I separated each portion of the html and labeled them. 

In the body I added the color #fff and font family Gil San',Gill Sans MT' Calibri 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; because the majority of the page had the same font color and font family. I deleted repetitive color and font family in the css.

Then, I reorganized the css to flow with the html and labeled it to correlate with the html.
I started replacing the header with semantic elements in the html and made sure the css was properly updated.  
I deleted the unnecessary class like in the h1 and kept it simple by keeping the span. I linked the search engine optimization navigation to the section.

I kept the .hero but add alt text.

I replaced the div with the semantic text section so it can be more defined in the html
I left the classes but combined the styling for the in the section to get rid of repetitiveness.

Then the aside in the html that had the element div to aside. I combined h3 styling to remove repetitiveness. Each image had the same styling so I combined each class in the css. Each image in the aside was labeled with alt text.

I removed the div and class in the footer and combined all of the styling under the element footer.
